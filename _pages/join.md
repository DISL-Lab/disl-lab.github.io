## How to join DISL Lab?

Prospective students interested in joining our lab or with inquiries, please contact us at <u>songhwanjun@kaist.ac.kr</u>. 

We are not hiring MS/PhD students or postdocs this 2025 Spring, but will have a few positions for next Fall. We are open to hire international students as well.

All candidates must submit their `CV`and a one-page `research statement`, covering but not limited to:
* **Previous Research Experience:** We encourage all candidates to have research experience, such as participating in research projects as interns or employees. Please include a brief overview of your previous research, your role, and the outcomes achieved. This section is optional for interns.
* **Research Interest and Potential Topics:** Candidates should focus on topics related to our recent works listed in the Publication tab. Applicants who have not read any of our papers are discouraged from applying for the roles. Kindly provide abstracts for potential topics based on more than two papers of interest. 

## Process of Application

The process involves multiple steps. First, the submitted materials will undergo `internal review` within our lab. Following this, we will schedule `a Zoom interview` for candidates who pass the initial screening. The preparation for the interview may vary depending on the specific positions the candidate has applied for. As an example, candidates applying for a PhD position may be invited to present their previous works and potential research interests at our internal Lab Seminar as part of the interview process. The details on the interview will be provided via e-mail.

## Research Environment
#### Working Culture
We cultivate a `flat working culture` to enable seamless communication with our supervisor. The supervisor actively collaborates with all students in research and coding endeavors. We encourage documenting all research deliverables in a single repository to facilitate quick familiarization for new students joining the lab.

#### Computing Resource
We are gradually expanding our computing resources. Presently, our lab possesses `a single node of A5000 with 4 GPUs` (4xA5000), `a single node of H100 with 8 GPUs (8xH100)` and `a single node of L40S with 8 GPUs (8xL40S)`. We have plans to acquire additional GPUs, once we secure research funding later this year.

#### Meeting and Seminar
Formally, we hold two regular appointments. A `quick sync-up` lasting 30 minutes for all students every Monday, and a `research seminar` lasting 1 hour every Thursday (see [our Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrEpnN7_2BmrHsPWns_Vx3Q)). For research projects with a clear submission target, we organize a `weekly meeting series` based on the needs of the students involved. Additionally, we have two `non-regular meeting` slots, each lasting 1 hour, available on Fridays. These slots are open for any students to schedule meetings with our supervisor as needed.

In addition, we are operating an `international joint paper reading group` every Thursday. There are two joint laboratories: GIST in Korea (Prof. Sundong Kim) and University of British Columnbia (Prof. Xiaoxiao Li) in Canada.

#### Strong Collaborator
We maintain strong connections with both industry and academia, collaborating with all the organizations listed below in the past. If you need other connection, we encourage you to invite them as collaborators.
* Industry: Amazon Web Services Inc., Google Research, NAVER AI Labs
* Academia: Soeul National University (SNU), Korea University, GIST, POSTECH, CNU, UBC 
* Research Institute: ETRI, KISTI, IBS
